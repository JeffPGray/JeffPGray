## The Firm

Built from **The Woodlands, Texas** and deployed nationally, Gray Reserve is a strategic growth firm for owners who have decided to **lead their category** rather than compete within it.

We combine proprietary data augmentation with full-service digital marketing — advertising management, web and eCommerce development, AI-powered growth systems, and executive-level consulting. Each discipline stands alone. Together, they compound market share rather than chase it.

No two engagements are alike. Every system, campaign, and strategy is architected from first principles for your specific business, market, and competitive position.

> *We do not recycle playbooks. We do not share client identities.*
> *What we build for you exists for you alone.*

## ⟡ The Build Stack

> *Every tool in the GR stack is purpose-built. Nothing off the shelf that doesn't earn its place.*

### `gr-performance` — WordPress Performance Suite

Replaces **WP-Optimize + Autoptimize + most caching plugins** — in a single, modular plugin.

```
Modules (each independently toggleable):
  ├── cache        Page caching layer
  ├── images       WebP + AVIF conversion & optimization
  ├── scripts      JS defer, async, and removal controls
  ├── styles       CSS optimization and unused rule elimination
  ├── html         HTML minification
  ├── hints        Resource hints (preload, prefetch, preconnect)
  ├── htaccess     Server-level performance tuning
  ├── assets       Conditional asset loading per post/page
  ├── cleanup      WordPress bloat removal
  ├── database     DB optimization and revision cleanup
  └── cron         Scheduled cache purge + weekly DB maintenance
```

One plugin. No plugin conflicts. No redundant overhead. Built on PHP 8.0+ with PSR-style autoloading.

---

### `gr-checkout` — WooCommerce Checkout Engine

Purpose-built conversion layer on top of WooCommerce's default checkout.

```
Features:
  ├── One-page streamlined checkout (reduced friction)
  ├── Configurable order bumps (pre-purchase add-ons)
  ├── Pre-checkout upsells (frequently bought together)
  └── Post-purchase thank-you upsells with countdown timer
```

Most stores bolt on 3–4 separate plugins to get this. GR Checkout handles all of it in one coherent system, without the inter-plugin conflicts that tank checkout performance.

---

### `gr-seo-companion` — Structured Data Layer

Extends The SEO Framework with schema types most SEO plugins skip entirely.

```
Schema output (JSON-LD, auto-injected via wp_head):
  ├── Product         Brand, GTIN, MPN, SKU, AggregateRating,
  │                   Offers (with sale price + valid date range)
  ├── Review          Individual WooCommerce reviews → ReviewList
  └── FAQPage         From product meta OR <details>/<summary>
  │                   elements in post/page content (zero config)
```

Runs as an `mu-plugin` — always on, no accidental deactivation. Google rich result eligible from day one.

---

### `gr-compare` — Apple-Style Product Comparison

```
  ├── Compare up to 4 WooCommerce products side-by-side
  ├── Sticky bottom bar (persistent across scroll)
  ├── Expandable spec tables
  ├── REST API endpoint for async product data
  ├── Shortcode-based placement
  └── localStorage persistence (survives page navigation)
```

The comparison UX that Shopify merchants pay $30/month for, built native to WooCommerce.

---

### `valor` — WordPress Theme

Thin modular loader architecture — all logic in `inc/` classes, autoloaded via PSR-style naming convention. Features gate behind license validation so the theme ships clean on any install.

```
Modules:
  ├── Valor_Setup          Theme support, nav menus, image sizes
  ├── Valor_Cleanup        WordPress bloat removal (emoji, oembed, etc.)
  ├── Valor_Assets         Conditional, versioned asset loading
  ├── Valor_WooCommerce    WC integration (loads only if WC active)
  ├── Valor_Mega_Menu      Full-featured mega menu system
  ├── Valor_Carousel       Product/content carousel
  ├── Valor_Wishlist       Native wishlist without plugin overhead
  ├── Valor_Size_Guide     Size guide modal system
  └── Valor_Pixel_Manager  Unified tracking pixel management
```
